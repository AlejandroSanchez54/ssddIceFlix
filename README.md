## Set up Project:

First you have to execute the following command:

`pip install -e .`

Then, you can execute the client with the next command:

`./run_client`


## Manual User:

First, when you start the client must found an IceStorm, if it is found ,it searches for any available main and picks a random one and opens the IceFlix interface where you can **login as user**, **login as administrator** and you can do an **anonimous search**. If you do a **login as user** it will request your username and the password and if it is correct it will show the user interface where you can do a search by name, search by tag, download a file. If you do a **login as administrator** and the admin token is correct it will show you the Administrator interface where you can add and remove user, rename media, remove and upload file and subscribe to the channel of the announcements, authenticators, mediacatalogs and fileservice. If you select **anonimous search** it will request the media name and it will show you the search if it exists with all the media id's. 
There are explanations that if you dont understand anything you can put help or ? to show information about the command. The option exit allows you to exit the application and also is implemented the **CTRL+D** option to exit.
